<p>Complex signup processes turn away customers. Slow loading pages cause users to leave quickly. Security breaches can cost days of downtime and massive liability. It's easy to lose users &amp; sales, but it takes knowledge to keep them. You need an experienced full-stack developer that can address usability, performance, security, and business value all at the same time. The expertise I bring ensures that your site works for your users, instead of being an obstacle.</p>

<p>This is what I do:</p>

<ul>
<li>Coding in PHP, Python, Javascript</li>
<li>Quality Assurance and User Acceptance Testing</li>
<li>Layout Improvement and UX</li>
<li>Server Dev Ops</li>
<li>Continuous Integration and Stability Improvement</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, I code strong and stable dynamic websites from the server to database to front-end and beyond.</p>

<a id="experience--expertise" class="anchor" href="#experience--expertise" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Experience &amp; Expertise</h3>

<ul>
<li>Php development for the web since 2003.</li>
<li>Developed custom php e-commerce and inventory-management systems.</li>
<li>Worked on social network sites and online small-business niche sites for my clients.</li>
<li>Overhauled the website shermanbrothers.com, moved it to new servers, updated it to html5, and cleaned up the codebase.</li>
</ul>

<p>I have over a decade's experience in creating clear, flexible, &amp; fast systems coded in PHP and javascript. I work across the full stack, from server deployment to server-side app to front-end, to MAXIMIZE how well your site works. Not just by creating code, but by analyzing and resolving problems that might otherwise turn away users &amp; decrease conversions.</p>

Security breaches can cost days of downtime and massive liability. It's easy to lose users & sales, but it takes knowledge to keep them. You need an experienced full-stack developer that can address usability, performance, security, and business value all at the same time. The expertise I bring ensures that your site works for your users, instead of being an obstacle.\r\n\r\nThis is what I do:\r\n- Coding in PHP, Python, Javascript\r\n- Quality Assurance and User Acceptance Testing\r\n- Layout Improvement and UX\r\n- Server Dev Ops\r\n- Continuous Integration and Stability Improvement\r\n\r\nIn short, I code strong and stable dynamic websites from the server to database to front-end and beyond.\r\n\r\n### Experience & Expertise\r\n* Php development for the web since 2003.\r\n* Developed custom php e-commerce and inventory-management systems.\r\n* Worked on social network sites and online small-business niche sites for my clients.\r\n* Overhauled the website shermanbrothers.com, moved it to new servers, updated it to html5, and cleaned up the codebase.\r\n\r\nI have over a decade's experience in creating clear, flexible, & fast systems coded in PHP and javascript. I work across the full stack, from server deployment to server-side app to front-end, to MAXIMIZE how well your site works. Not just by creating code, but by analyzing and resolving problems that might otherwise turn away users & decrease conversions.\r\n\r\n### Technologies:\r\n * I work on open source projects and sites on github.\r\n * I design systems in php, mysql/postgresql, javascript, jquery, html5, and css3.\r\n * I use Test Driven Design via phpunit or behat, and templating engines like Twig and Smarty\r\n * I deploy debian based virtual servers with AWS or Rackspace.\r\n\r\nIf you have a web problem that you need expertly solved: Let's chat.",
